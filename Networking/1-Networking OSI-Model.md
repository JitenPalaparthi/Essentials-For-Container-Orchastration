### Network OSI Model

- The Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model that describes the universal standard of communication functions of a telecommunication system or computing system, without any regard to the system's underlying internal technology and specific protocol suites. 

| Layers | Physical | Datalink | Network | Transport | Session | Presentation | Application |
| -------| -------- | -------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Protocol Data Unit[PDU] | Bit | Frame | Packet | Segment/Datagram | Data | Data | Data |
| Notes | Physical Connection Between Devices | This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer | Addressing routing and delivery of datagrams between point to point networks | reliable delivery of segments between points on a network | interhost communication , managing session between applications.It provides services such as connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing. | Data representation , encryption decryption, converting machine dependent data to machine independent data | Network processes to the applications like web applications , Emails, Messengers |
| Device | Eithernet PHY,Hubs, Repeaters, Cables, Fibers, Wireless | Bridges, Modems, Network cards, 2-layer switches | Routers, Brouters, 3-layer switches | Gateways, Firewalls | Gateways, Firewalls, PC’s | Gateways, Firewalls, PC's | Gateways,Firewalls, all end devices like PC’s, Phones, Servers |
| Communication | Electrons(Signals On-Off) | Frames are sent to a specific switch port based on destination MAC addresses | packets are sent to a specific next-hop IP address, based on destination IP address | Reliable Communication on IP:Ports | Data communication on IPs and Ports on IPs and Ports on Protocals like TCP,UDP,HTTP| Data Communication on IPs and Ports on Protocals like TCP,UDP,HTTP | Data Communication on IPs and Ports on Protocals like TCP,UDP,HTTP |
| Services | The physical layer performs bit-by-bit or symbol-by-symbol data delivery over a physical transmission medium | -Encapsulation of network layer data packets into frames -Physical addressing (MAC addressing) -Error Control (Automatic Repeat Request) - LAN switching (packet switching), including MAC filtering, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) and TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) - Data packet queuing or scheduling | Connectionless communication from source to destination via one or more networks | - Connection oriented communication as a data stream . - Order or delivery . - Reliability . - Flow Control . - Multiplexing: Ports can provide multiple end points on a single node. | - Session checkoint of recovery. - Authentication. - Authorization. | - Data conversion. - Charcode translation . - Compression . - Encryption-Decryption . - Serialization | - Process-Process Communication. - RESTFul Communication - gPRC,SMTP Communication via applications, Client-Server , Peer-Peer networking model implementations |
